# Iris-Flower-Classifier

This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building a classifier model to predict the species of iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

The notebook is organized as follows:

1.Importing necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.
2.Loading the Iris dataset and performing initial exploration.
3.Preprocessing the data by scaling features and handling missing values if any.
4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
5.Building a machine learning model using K-means clustering.- Further analysis using hierarchical clustering.

By the end of this notebook, we aim to have a well-organized codebase with comments to guide the reader through each step of the analysis and model building process.
